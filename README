== Introduction ==

al4anim was initially written by Brandon McCaig in response to a request
for help on http://www.allegro.cc. He decided to turn it into a library
in case it could be useful to himself or others later.

== Build Instructions ==

al4anim was originally written and tested in GNU/Linux. The Makefile
should work for most similar environments, particularly unices. There are
no directions to build for Windows at this time, though it should suffice
to bake the source directly into your project if you must.

Using GNU build tools, you should be able to build the code by running
make.

$ make

If you just want the library and don't care about the example program,
then specify you want just the library.

$ make library

al4anim is currently built into a static library because of its
relatively small size.

== Example Program ==

The example program was written using sprites that were attached by the
OP to the thread on http://www.allegro.cc. Since we don't know about the
ownership or licensing of those files they are not distributed as part of
al4anim. If you wish to run the example program then you will need to
retreive those files from http://www.allegro.cc:

http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/605346/886764#target

Those files should be placed in a 'media' directory.

If you don't want to (or can't) retreive those files then you should be
able to use any animation files that you want. Just modify src/main.c to
use your own files instead of the originals.
