== Introduction ==

al4anim was initially written by Brandon McCaig in response to a request
for help on http://www.allegro.cc. He decided to turn it into a library
in case it could be useful to himself or others later.

== Build Instructions ==

al4anim was originally written and tested in GNU/Linux. The Makefile
should work for most similar environments, particularly unices. There are
no directions to build for Windows at this time, though it should suffice
to bake the source directly into your project if you must.

Using GNU build tools, you should be able to build the code by running
make.

$ make

If you just want the library and don't care about the example program,
then specify you want just the library.

$ make library

al4anim is currently built into a static library because of its
relatively small size.

== Installing The Library ==

You need to copy include/a4a_animation.h and lib/libal4anim.a into paths
where your compiler expects them. In GNU/Linux, a good candidate is into
/usr, such as /usr/include and /usr/lib. Another candiate is /usr/local,
such as /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib. Not all distributions
configure ld to search /usr/local, however, so you may need to add an
entry to /etc/ld.so.conf[.d] and run `ldconfig` as root to update the
cache.

Alternatively, you can use the shell environment by setting CPATH to
al4anim's include directory (where a4a_animation.h is) and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to al4anim's lib directory (where libal4anim.a is). You can also just pass
the necessary arguments to your compiler. For example, with gcc, you can
pass -I/path/to/al4anim/include and -L/path/to/al4anim/lib. Which option
you choose will largely depend on your system configuration and your
privileges on it.

== Using The Library ==

Once al4anim is properly installed on your system, you can use the
library! You will need to include a4a_animation.h in any header or source
files that reference al4anim's data types or subroutines. You will also
need to link to a4anim. With gcc, you can do that with the -l option:
-la4anim.

For example, using gcc, your command line might be something like:

gcc -o game `allegro-config --libs` -la4anim

If you wish to use a4anim with PNG files then you will need a few more
libraries as dependencies.

* loadpng
* libpng
* zlib

Your command line with gcc might then look like:

gcc -o game `allegro-config --libs` -la4anim -lldpng -lpng -lz

The order of libraries matters. Apparently you should keep them at the end
of the command line. I can't say for sure, but it seems to work for me.
Take a look at the Makefile to see the command(s) that work for me.

== I Can't Get It Installed; Can I Still Use It? ==

Probably, yes. You can just copy include/a4a_animation.h and
src/a4a_animation.c into your own project and build them as if they were
part of your project all along.

== Example Program ==

The example program was written using sprites that were attached by the
OP to the thread on http://www.allegro.cc. Since we don't know about the
ownership or licensing of those files they are not distributed as part of
al4anim. If you wish to run the example program then you will need to
retreive those files from http://www.allegro.cc:

http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/605346/886764#target

Those files should be placed in a 'media' directory.

If you don't want to (or can't) retreive those files then you should be
able to use any animation files that you want. Just modify src/main.c to
use your own files instead of the originals.

== Getting Updates, Reporting Bugs, Contributing, Providing Feedback ==

al4anim is offically hosted on GitHub. You can clone the repository using
Git to get the updated source code. You can use the GitHub Web site to
search for more information, look for bugs or issues, report bugs or
issues, or contribute your own code.
